**Preload ** 
Allows crictical resources to be load before they are discovered. Only Preload resources that need to be used instantly(1-3sec). You shouldn't be improving for interactivity at the cost of delaying resources which are important for FCP & LCP(Hero Images and fonts).
A preloaded resource will get preloaded no matter what[low bandwidth, poor internet connection]
